### Problem Statement: 
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately (more than 85% accuracy)estimate insurance premiums based on a variety of input features.
### Business understanding
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) working paper titled "Insurance Premiums: Determinants and Policy Implications," there are several challenges that insurance companies face when determining insurance premiums. Insurance companies must assess the risk of an insurance event occurring for each policyholder, taking into account a wide range of factors such as the policyholder's age, gender, medical history, and the type and cost of coverage. This can be a complex and time-consuming process.
